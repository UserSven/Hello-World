# Hello-World
1.Repository

I'm new to all of this aspecially in doing something. My interest in Computer programing is driveing my curiositey for a while now, and I decided to take action. 

I used to work in the Catering Industrie, and cooking is stil my passion. However it is all there is. 
My interest's have changed and I'm looking also for a change in my career path. 

Reacentley I have completed a course and passed a exam for a certification as a ISPO (Internacional Scrum Product Owner), the general idea for a Agile framework is something that I recognised my self in.

The layout of the hirearchey, the responsibilites, all things in the Agile framework is something captivating for me.

I find programming very interesting because it is a language that can make a fizikal impact on things, in other words devices we now use on a daily basis can be alterd, enhanced and my favorite simplefied. 

Being creative, from my former proffesion i love to implement the cooking teory in other aspects of my life. 

Keeping it simple and organised, prep is 90% of work.

However I still have some dificulties regarding on the topic. I'm still trying to figureout how to take some or any advantege of my Dyslexia and find out more about my personalitie INFJ-A/INFJ-T.
